## Description

## Known Issues
- Level 94 Town -> Level 94 Clown does not split in load screen for some reason
- Ending is inconsistent, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't
- If you die and let the death cutscene roll, it seems to split; if you restart level before it forces the restart though, it will not split.
